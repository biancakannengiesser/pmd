Title: Fun Dojo

This app targets children, especially those in kindergarten. It is created to help them learn the basics for their age, like colors, some animals, vegetables, fruits, the alphabet and also a little bit pf mathematics. Every "section" has photos and also sound attached to it, which makes is a lot easier for kids to learn and remember the notions. The mathematics part includes a mini-test, which allows the children to practice calculations and get feedback instanstly.

The application is created using Android Studio and Firebase. I created an activity for every screen and designed it to be very user friendly and simple for kids to use it. The app is available for everyone, but in order to use it you have to sign up or log in with your account, data which will be stored in a database. Only name, email and password are required to create an account.
